# sudoku
A sudoku game, generator, and solver developed in python

Run sudokuGame.py to play in terminal

sudokuGenerator and sudokuSolver can both be configured in their main functions
to run independently

bruteForceSudoku is a modified version of a backtracking algorithm I found in an online tutorial,
which I used to compare to my own algorithm

there is also a scraper that can pull the daily sudokus from the NYT and solve them, though it requires
requests and beautifulsoup
